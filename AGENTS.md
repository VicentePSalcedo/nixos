# Agent Session Summary for NixOS Repository

        This document summarizes key actions and learnings from a session to help with future
    interactions.

        ## Repository Context

        - The repository uses Nix flakes for system configuration.
        - Configuration is organized into modules within the `modules/` directory (e.g., `hyprland`,
    `gnome`, `i3`).
        - The main system configuration is in `wraith/configuration.nix`, which imports various modules.
        - User-specific configuration is handled via Home Manager, imported from the `./home` directory.
        - Git is used for version control, and untracked files/directories are not included in the Nix
    flake source.
        - A `just` command (`just switch`) is used by the user to build and deploy the system
    configuration, which also handles Git add/commit/push operations.

        ## Tasks Performed in Session

        - Created a new module directory for KDE Plasma: `modules/kde`.
        - Added a `default.nix` file to the `modules/kde` directory.
        - Added basic KDE Plasma 6 configuration (`services.desktopManager.plasma6.enable = true;`,
    `services.xserver.enable = true;`) to `modules/kde/default.nix`.
        - Added `../modules/kde` to the `imports` list in `wraith/configuration.nix`.
        - Troubleshooted and resolved a conflict caused by multiple display managers being enabled
    simultaneously (LightDM and SDDM).
        - Refactored display manager configuration by creating a new module:
    `modules/display-managers/lightdm.nix`.
        - Moved the LightDM configuration block from `modules/hyprland/default.nix` to
    `modules/display-managers/lightdm.nix`.
        - Removed display manager-specific configurations from `modules/hyprland/default.nix` and
    `modules/i3/default.nix` to ensure they only configure their respective desktop environments.
        - Imported `../modules/display-managers/lightdm.nix` into `wraith/configuration.nix`.
        - Ensured both `../modules/kde` and `../modules/hyprland` (and others as needed) are imported so
     their sessions are available via the single enabled display manager (LightDM).

        ## Key Learnings & Future Considerations

        - **Display Managers:** Only one display manager should be enabled globally. Conflicting display
     manager configurations in imported modules will cause build errors. Centralizing display manager
    configuration into a single imported module is the preferred method here.
        - **Module Design:** Desktop environment modules should ideally focus only on the DE-specific
    configuration and not enable global services like display managers that are handled elsewhere.
        - **Git Tracking:** New files or directories relevant to the Nix configuration must be tracked
    by Git (`git add`) for them to be included in the flake's source derivation.
        - **User Workflow:** The user's `just switch` command is the primary method for applying
    configuration changes, which includes Git operations. Avoid performing separate `git add`, `commit`,
     or `push` actions.
        - **File Editing:** Be mindful when using shell commands like `sed` for complex edits; verify
    the result. `apply_patch` is generally preferred but may require retries or alternative methods for
    new files or complex contexts.
